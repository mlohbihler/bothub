<p>
  The Game of Intelligen Design (GID) is a simulation platform for writing system control software. Honestly, it's more
  fun than that sounds.

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Challenges</dt>
  <dd>
    The game is split into sections called <strong>challenges</strong>, which are like levels except that you don't
    really need to do them in any particular order. You complete challenges by achieving a given goal.
  </dd>

  <dt>Agent</dt>
  <dd>
    Challenges include at least one <strong>agent</strong>, which is the thing that your script controls. The agent(s)
    exist in an environment, with which it interacts.
  </dd>

  <dt>Script</dt>
  <dd>
    The left side of the interface has an editor with which you can write your javascript code. It needs to have a
    <code>step</code> function, and optionally can also have a <code>setup</code> function. See below for further
    details of how to use these functions. The setup function is called once every time you save your script. The step
    function is called 60 times a second (usually), and is how you control the agent.
  </dd>

  <dt>Sensors</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Sensor</strong>s are the data that the agent is aware of, like what it can feel, smell, see, etc. Your
    script will use this data to decide what the agent should do. Each challenge will define it's own sensors, so you
    should always check the challenge docs.
  </dd>

  <dt>Actuators</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Actuator</strong>s are the things that the agent can do, like move, turn, eat, etc. Each challenge will
    define it's own actuators, so you should always check the challenge docs.
  </dd>
</dl>

<a id="scripts"></a>
<h2>Script Details</h2>
<p>
  Your script is the link between sensors and actuators, taking what the agent can sense, and turning that into action.
  The main things you need to know about are
</p>

<a id="scripts-setup"></a>
<h3>Setup Function</h3>
<p>
  The <code>setup</code> function should return a hash object containing the setup options. Currently the only thing to
  return is key handlers, for which you can use the <code>keyHandlers</code> key. The Forward challenge has an example
  of key handlers. But a useful thing to know is that there are two <code>action</code> types: <code>repeat</code> and
  <code>debounce</code>. The former will cause the handler to run as long as the key is depressed. The latter will
  ensure that the handler is only called once for every time the key is pressed.
</p>

<a id="scripts-step"></a>
<h3>Step Function</h3>
<p>The <code>step</code> function takes three parameters and doesn't return anything.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Parameter</td>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>evt</td>
    <td>Object / Hash</td>
    <td>
      The step event contains game data pertaining to the current step. These are the keys:
      <dl>
        <dt>step</dt>
        <dd>An integer representing the current simulation step, starting from 0.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>timestamp</dt>
        <dd>The number of seconds since the start of the simulation, including 3 millisecond decimals.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>keyEvents</dt>
        <dd>
          An array of DOM <code>KeyboardEvent</code> objects. The best way to use this data is with
          <code>keyHandlers</code> in your <code>setup</code> code.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>debugProps</dt>
        <dd>
          An object that allows you to add arbitrary key/value entries that will be displayed in the interface. Here's
          an example of how to use this:
          <br /><br />
          <code class="snippet">evt.debugProps.Time = GID.formatTime(evt.timestamp)</code>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>debugRenderers</dt>
        <dd>
          An array that allows you to push functions that draw onto the graphics context. Functions accept a helper
          parameter, which is an instance of a class that provides a number of convenience methods. Here is an example
          of a function you could write:
          <br /><br />
          <code class="snippet">evt.debugRenderers.push(h => h.dot(300, 100, 2, '#f88'))</code>
          <br />
          This uses the <code>dot</code> method to draw a red-ish dot at x=300 and y=100 with radius 2. Here are the
          methods you can call on the helper class:

          <br /><br />
          <code class="snippet">
            dot(x: number, y: number, r: number, style: string)<br />
            circle(x: number, y: number, r: number, style: string, width = 1)<br />
            line(sx: number, sy: number, ex: number, ey: number, style: string, width = 3)<br />
            rect(x1: number, y1: number, x2: number, y2: number, style: string, width = 3)<br />
            getContext()<br />
          </code>
          <br />

          The method <code>getContext</code> returns the graphics context, allowing you to write your own custom
          rendering code.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sensors</td>
    <td>Object / Hash</td>
    <td>The sensors for the current challenge. See the challenge docs for details.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actuators</td>
    <td>Object / Hash</td>
    <td>The actuators for the current challenge. See the challenge docs for details.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Globals</h3>
<p>
  The GID namespace provides a number of convenience functions you can use in your scripts. These include:
  <br /><br />
  <code class="snippet">
    formatTime(time: number)<br />
    shorten(n: number) // Removes excess decimals from the given number, preserving precision<br />
  </code>
</p>

<h2>Boring Technical Details</h2>
<p>
  In case you were wondering, this game has no backend slash server-side. Your scripts, progress, and other state are
  stored using local browser storgae. The good news is that there you don't need to registers or anything. The downside
  is that your scripts can't be sync'ed across your devices, you can't compare your progress with others, and neat stuff
  like that. Also, you may find that your scripts get pretty big and cumbersome for the inline editor. We are
  considering other delivery mechanisms that would address problems like these.
</p>

<p>
  Players of this game are probably going to already know this - since it's likely that you already have software
  development experience - but if you open your browser's debugging tools you'll have access to the console, debugging,
  local storage, profiling, and other rather useful stuff.
</p>

<h2>Even More Boring... Philosohy</h2>
<p>
  So, what is the actual good of a game that you can't play yourself? Why would anyone want the computer to have all the
  fun? I get it. It's true that you need to be at a boss level of nerdiness to want to spend your game playing hours
  writing code. Whatever... you know who you are.
</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this game is meant to be a path toward AGI.</p>
