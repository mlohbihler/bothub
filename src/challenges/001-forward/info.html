<h1>Challenge: <i>Forward</i></h1>
<p>
  This is an introductory challenge to familiarize users with the game concepts. It's super simple. In fact, the
  solution is in the sample code. Reading the comments there is strongly recommended. Go do that now and then come back.
  Take all the time you need. I'll wait here. Doo da doop da doop... &#127925;

<h2>Sensors</h2>
This challenge doesn't have any sensors. Focus your attention on the actuators for now.

<h2>Actuators</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Range</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>speed</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves forward or backward.</td>
    <td>-0.5 ... 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>turn</td>
    <td>Rate of turning.</td>
    <td>-&#x03C0;/12 ... &#x03C0;/12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sidle</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves side to side.</td>
    <td>-0.4 ... 0.4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  Move the agent into the goal area, being the yellow circle. It will turn green when the goal is achieved. You cannot
  press any keys during execution, otherwise the goal area will deactivate and turn grey/gray tomato/tomato.
