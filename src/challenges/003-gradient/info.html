<h1>Challenge: <i>Gradient</i></h1>
<p>
  In this challenge you need to follow a gradient trail. There are targes along the way, each of which needs to be
  touched.
</p>
<p>
  This challenge is a little complex, but it is pretty satisfying to watch it working. In the default code there is
  solution marked as a spoiler.

  TIP: Your script can include the <code>debugger</code> keyword, which can be handy, but it can also be a nuisance
  because you can't edit your script while the debugger is active. If you find yourself stuck, close the devtools
  windown, edit your code to remove these statements as necessary (and maybe refresh the page), and then reopen
  devtools. A reasonable approach is to use <code>debugger</code> in a constructor or similar run-once-ish block, and
  then set breakpoints in the devtools, which you can then remove without having to close the tools.

<h2>Sensors</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>amount</td>
    <td>
      The amount of the gradient that is currently being sensed at the nose of the agent. As the agent turns - without
      any translational movement - this amount can change.
    </td>
  </tr>

<h2>Actuators</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Range</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>speed</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves forward or backward.</td>
    <td>-0.5 ... 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>turn</td>
    <td>Rate of turning.</td>
    <td>-&#x03C0;/12 ... &#x03C0;/12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sidle</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves side to side.</td>
    <td>-0.4 ... 0.4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  Move the agent along the gradient path, touching each of the targets along the way in the order given by the gradient
  amount.
