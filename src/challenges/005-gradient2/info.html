<h1>Challenge: <i>Gradient 2</i></h1>
<p>
  This challenge is similar to the original Gradient, but now is it possible for the agent to be completely within an
  area where the gradient amount does not change. As such, the solution for Gradient will not work. Instead, what is
  likely needed is some manner of memory of the likley general direction of the gradient.

<h2>Sensors</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>amount</td>
    <td>
      The amount of the gradient that is currently being sensed at the nose of the agent. As the agent turns - without
      any translational movement - this amount can change.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Actuators</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Range</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>speed</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves forward or backward.</td>
    <td>-0.5 ... 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>turn</td>
    <td>Rate of turning.</td>
    <td>-&#x03C0;/12 ... &#x03C0;/12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sidle</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves side to side.</td>
    <td>-0.4 ... 0.4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  Move the agent along the gradient path, touching each of the targets along the way in the order given by the gradient
  amount.
