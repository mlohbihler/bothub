<h1>Challenge: <i>Gather</i></h1>
<p>
  This challenge provides you with two internal path integrators that give you distance and angle information to the
  target and the goal.
</p>
<!-- <p class="highlight">
  TIP: Your script can include the <code>debugger</code> keyword, which can be handy, but it can also be a nuisance
  because you can't edit your script while the debugger is active. If you find yourself stuck, close the devtools
  windown, edit your code to remove these statements as necessary (and maybe refresh the page), and then reopen
  devtools. A reasonable approach is to use <code>debugger</code> in a constructor or similar run-once-ish block, and
  then set breakpoints in the devtools, which you can then remove without having to close the tools.

<h2>Sensors</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>prevVelocityAchieved</td>
    <td>Vec2</td>
    <td>
      The x/y translational change WRT the agent's center that was achieved in the last step. Note that the agent can
      request any speed, turn, or sidle it wants, but what actually is achieved is subject to things like physiological
      constraints, fatigue, illness, obstacles, or terrain. Also, the values have been rounded to 2 decimal places,
      since no sensor values should ever be considered exact.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prevAngularVelocityAchieved</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      The actual amount of orientation change made in the previous step. The value has been rounded to 2 decimal places,
      since no sensor values should ever be considered exact.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>contactAngle</td>
    <td>number | undefined</td>
    <td>The angle WRT to the nose that contact was made between the agent and another body.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>targetDistance</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>The distance in units from the center of the agent to the center of the target body.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>targetAngleDiff</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      The difference between the agent's heading and target, or put another way, the amount the agent's heading should
      be changed to point toward the target position.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>goalDistance</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>The distance in units from the center of the agent to the center of the goal.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>goalAngleDiff</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      The difference between the agent's heading and goal, or put another way, the amount the agent's heading should be
      changed to point toward the goal.

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The goal is to push the target body back to the goal area.</p>
