<h1>Challenge: <i>Path Integration</i></h1>
<p>
  Path integration is a mechanism that nesting animals can use to find their way back. It consists of maintaining a
  vector (i.e. the angle and distance) back to where they started. This challenge provides you with a path integration
  class, but you can write your own.

<!-- <p class="highlight">
  TIP: Your script can include the <code>debugger</code> keyword, which can be handy, but it can also be a nuisance
  because you can't edit your script while the debugger is active. If you find yourself stuck, close the devtools
  windown, edit your code to remove these statements as necessary (and maybe refresh the page), and then reopen
  devtools. A reasonable approach is to use <code>debugger</code> in a constructor or similar run-once-ish block, and
  then set breakpoints in the devtools, which you can then remove without having to close the tools.

      The x/y translational change WRT the agent's center that was achieved in the last step. Note that the agent can
      request any speed, turn, or sidle it wants, but what actually is achieved is subject to things like physiological
      constraints, fatigue, illness, obstacles, or terrain. Also, the values have been rounded to 2 decimal places,
      since no sensor values should ever be considered exact.

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  The goal is to set out from the center, make contact with another object, and then return to the start. Other objects
  will appear at a given range of distance from the starting point at random angles.
