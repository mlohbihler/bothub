<h1>Challenge: <i>Turn</i></h1>
<p>
  In this challenge you need to move forward and turn. This time the target is not right in front of the agent. There
  are two ways to accomplish this...
</p>
<p>
  You could turn the agent until it is pointing at the target, and then move. The trick here is that you need to store
  state, i.e. turning vs moving.
</p>
<p>
  Or, you can turn and move at the same time in the right proportions to hit the target. The trouble is finding values
  that work.
</p>
<p>The sample code provides almost-working versions of each approach.</p>

  TIP: If you can't see the agent or goal area, you can scale the environment view with your mouse wheel, or drag it
  around.

<h2>Sensors</h2>
This challenge doesn't have any sensors. Focus your attention on the actuators for now.

<h2>Actuators</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Key</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Range</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>speed</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves forward or backward.</td>
    <td>-0.5 ... 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>turn</td>
    <td>Rate of turning.</td>
    <td>-&#x03C0;/12 ... &#x03C0;/12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sidle</td>
    <td>How fast the agent moves side to side.</td>
    <td>-0.4 ... 0.4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  Move the agent into the goal area, being the yellow circle. It will turn green when the goal is achieved. You cannot
  press any keys during execution, otherwise the goal area will deactivate and turn grey/gray tomato/tomato.
