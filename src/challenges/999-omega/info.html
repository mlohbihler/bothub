<h1>Challenge: <i>All Dressed</i></h1>
<p>
  This challenge isn't so much a challenge - it doesn't have a goal - as much as a more comprehensive environment in
  which to play around. It has edibles (food and water) that appears in places that depend on the type, obstacles,
  whiskers, metabolism, ambience, and more. Here you can decide you're own goals and write code to solve them.

  <tr>
    <td>prevVelocityAchieved</td>
    <td>Vec2</td>
    <td>
      The x/y translational change WRT the agent's center that was achieved in the last step. Note that the agent can
      request any speed, turn, or sidle it wants, but what actually is achieved is subject to things like physiological
      constraints, fatigue, illness, obstacles, or terrain. Also, the values have been rounded to 2 decimal places,
      since no sensor values should ever be considered exact.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>prevAngularVelocityAchieved</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      The actual amount of orientation change made in the previous step. The value has been rounded to 2 decimal places,
      since no sensor values should ever be considered exact.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bodyContacts</td>
    <td>{ angle: number, normalImpulse: number, tangentImpulse: number }[]</td>
    <td>
      Array of contacts made against the body of the agent. The angle is the contact point on the body surface with
      respect to the center of the body, where the nose is 0.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>whiskers</td>
    <td>{ [key: 'tl' | 'l' | 'hl' | 'h' | 'hr' | 'r' | 'tr': number }</td>
    <td>
      Contact information for the agent's whiskers. The presence of an entry indicates that a contact exists. The number
      value represents the depth of the contact from the tip of the whisker.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>hunger</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      Hunger ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (very hungry), and represents the level of energy the agent has in its resources.
      Fatigue from hunger can reduce physical performance. Energy is metabolized at a constant rate, but also during
      movement.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>thirst</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      Thirst ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (very thirsty), and represents the level of water the agent has in its resources.
      Fatigue from hunger can reduce physical performance. Water is metabolized at a constant rate, but also during
      movement.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>illness</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>
      Illness represents a range of physoilogical conditions, including low levels of minerium and viterium, and high
      levels of toxium, minerium, viterium, and water.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fatigue</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>Fatigue is caused by overexertion, and limits the speed at which the agent can move.</td>

    <td>drinking</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Whether the agent is currently drinking. This state renders the agent prone for three seconds.</td>

    <td>noseTexture</td>
    <td>hex as string</td>
    <td>
      A value representing the texture the nose can sense, consisting of smoothness, temperature, and solidity. Textures
      take 0.5 seconds to recognize.

  <tr>
    <td>noseScent</td>
    <td>hex as string</td>
    <td>
      A value representing the scent the nose can sense, consisting of four unnamed attributes. Scents take three
      seconds to recognize.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ambience</td>
    <td>hex as string</td>
    <td>
      A value representing the ambience of the area the agent is currently within, consisting of brightness, humidity,
      and colour. Ambience can be used for self locating and path finding.

  <tr>
    <td>startDrink</td>
    <td>
      Set to true to have the agent consume a water body, which must be in contact with the nose. This will disable all
      other actuators for a period of time whether. (See <code>drinking</code> in sensors.) The edible will be eaten
      immediately, but takes time to digest.

  <tr>
    <td>startEat</td>
    <td>
      Set to true to have the agent consume a food edible, which must be in contact with the nose. This will disable all
      other actuators for a period of time. (See <code>drinking</code> in sensors.) The edible will be eaten
      immediately, but takes time to digest.
